# Graduate-Student-Employability-Prediction
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict graduate employability using a Kaggle dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory visualization to identify key patterns. Multiple models were trained and compared to determine the most accurate predictor.
