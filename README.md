## üß≠ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately classify whether a student is employable or not. The process involves:

* Data preprocessing and cleaning
* Feature engineering and selection
* Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights
* Model training, comparison, and evaluation
* Feature importance analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**

* Handled missing values and inconsistencies
* Encoded categorical variables
* Standardized numerical features for model optimization

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

* Derived new features to improve predictive performance
* Removed redundant or weakly correlated attributes

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Visualized correlations, distributions, and relationships using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**
* Identified trends and patterns related to employability

### 4. **Model Development**

Trained and compared multiple supervised learning algorithms:

* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Gradient Boosting Classifier

### 5. **Model Evaluation**

Each model was evaluated based on:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* ROC-AUC Curve

The best-performing model was selected based on overall accuracy and generalization performance.
